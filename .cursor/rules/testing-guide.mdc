# Testing Guide

This repository uses Deno's built-in testing tools with BDD-style syntax.

## Test Structure

- Tests are located in the `tests/` directory
- Each test file corresponds to a source file, with a `_test.ts` suffix

## Testing Utilities

- `std/testing/bdd.ts`: Provides `describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`
- `std/assert/mod.ts`: Provides assertions like `assertEquals`, `assertMatch`, `assertRejects`
- `std/testing/mock.ts`: Provides spying functions like `spy`, `assertSpyCalls`, `assertSpyCallArg`

## Testing Best Practices

1. Use dependency injection for better testability (see `mockDeps` in OAuth tests)
2. When testing log messages, use `assertMatch` with a regex pattern
3. For comparing complex objects, use `assertEquals`
4. For async code, use `assertRejects` to test error conditions

For examples, see [tests/node-oauth-client-provider_test.ts](mdc:tests/node-oauth-client-provider_test.ts)
